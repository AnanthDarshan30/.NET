# **.NET**
 **-->**  All my .NET and ASP.NET core applications and web APIs in one repo.

 ## ***Prerequisites***


## **Guide**
 These are my projects and things I learnt along the way when I started working on **.NET**, 
 things which helped me understand the concept thorugh hands on experience.

 The **Solutions** folder contains multiple solutions, where each solution holds a purpose and contains multiple projects. 
 Each solution's purpose is usually understood by the name of the solution.
 ## *Main Solutions:-*
 - **API** -> Contains API projects 

 - **Library** -> Contains basic and reusable modules/projects which can be used in other projects regularly. 

- **MySQL** -> Contains database related projects, integration with MySQl database.

- **Algorithms** -> Basic DSA practice occasionally, apart from online LeetCode and Other platforms. Here, I usually try to solve DSA using c# instead of c++ (which I usually use to solve DSA).

- **OOPS** -> One of my initial solutions, where I learnt and implemented OOPS concepts to furthur understand how they work programmatically instead of just theoretically.

# **.NET**
 **-->**  All my .NET and ASP.NET core applications and web APIs in one repo.

 ## ***Prerequisites***
 - Install [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community), ignore if you already have it installed.
    ### ***Add support for .Net Framework, ASP.NET, API Development, MySQL***
    1. Open Visual Studio Installer (*you'll usually find it in the search menu*) 
    2. Modify the Visual Studio Community.
    3. Select Required Workloads, some of them are:-
            - .Net Desktop Development
            - ASP.NET and web development
            - .NET core cross-platform developent
            - Data Storage and Procession (*optional*)
 - Install [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) so you can use actual data with most of these projects, mainly for APIs and working projects like Student Management System.
 - Install [Angular](https://v17.angular.io/guide/setup-local)      
## **Guide**
 These are my projects and things I learnt along the way when I started working on **.NET**, 
 things which helped me understand the concept thorugh hands on experience.

 > ### **NOTE: ** - *I have pushed my entire solutions folder to the repo, so when you clone it, make sure you just copy paste the files to your vs community to run them on your settings, instead of pasting the entire solutions folder as it's prone to lot of errors depending on the version your visual community is using and so on.*

 The **Solutions** folder contains multiple solutions, where each solution holds a purpose and contains multiple projects. 
 Each solution's purpose is usually understood by the name of the solution.
 ## *Main Solutions:-*
 - **API** -> Contains API projects 

 - **Library** -> Contains basic and reusable modules/projects which can be used in other projects regularly. 

- **MySQL** -> Contains database related projects, integration with MySQl database.

- **Algorithms** -> Basic DSA practice occasionally, apart from online LeetCode and Other platforms. Here, I usually try to solve DSA using c# instead of c++ (which I usually use to solve DSA).

- **OOPS** -> One of my initial solutions, where I learnt and implemented OOPS concepts to furthur understand how they work programmatically instead of just theoretically.

> I am still working on the readme.md file update, this is just the initial patch :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
